# Vendor-Buyer

1. the backend side of my project is totally based on Node.js with express.js framework
2. the front end side of my website is designed by myself using ejs and css technologies
3. the NoSQL database Includes mondo-DB with framework called as mongoose.
4. I have applied 5th level security using passport.js framework.
5. the Oauth 2.0 was not applied by me as i had to post this project on github server which would lead to discrepancy of client-ID from google.
6. my approach always remain first the frontend development of the web app and then the backend development.
7. the backend development includes first the database part and at the last my favourite approach towards the security part.
